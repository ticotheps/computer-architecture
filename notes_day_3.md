# ALU = Arithmetic Logic Unit

- Piece of separate hardware on the CPU.
- Does mathematical calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.).
- Also does comparisons (anything that is good at math is good at comparisons).
  - i.e. - if you can subtract one number from another, you can figure out which
    number is greater than/less than the other number.

# STACKS

- Inside the CPU, we want to use a 'Stack()' data structure.
- Methods in the 'Stack()' class:
  - push()
  - pop()
  - size()
- When things are pushed into the stack, these items are stored in the RAM
